In order to find her mother, Zachary stepped on the magic subway without hesitation! When the train arrived at the station, Zachary found that he had come to a magical world of elves. He also met the elf Rooney chased by hunters. In order to protect the Rooney, they fled to the underground city. Here, Zachary meets Scarlett, a red haired girl, and Zachary accidently becomes the Rooney and is regarded as a half-face hunter who is under searched with big bonus in the underground city. In order to leave the underground city to find his mother, Zachary has to agree to fight with the old wizard, the King of the underground city. Under Scarlett's training, Zachary grew up fast. In the battle, his determination to protect the Rooney inspired the strength in the necklace and defeated the old wizard. And just when the angry wizard decided to show his real strength, the real half hunter came to the rescue. The real half hunter even had the same necklace. The unexpected encounter of the two necklaces triggered the emergence of spirits and demons which are eager for energy. In order to protect the underground city from being ravage, the half-face hunter left the underground city with Zachary and his friends. They used their tactics to temporarily eliminate the demons in the stone forest near the beast forest, and they entered the beast forest to avoid refuge.</desc>

    <desc>One day, 12-year-old Zachary once again met the subway "0" which her mother took nine years ago, and the appearance of the subway seems to have some connection with the necklace left by her mother. In order to find her mother, Zachary stepped on the magic subway without hesitation! When the train arrived at the station, Zachary found that he had come to a magical world of elves. He also met the elf Rooney chased by hunters. In order to protect the Rooney, they fled to the underground city. Here, Zachary meets Scarlett, a red haired girl, and Zachary accidently becomes the Rooney and is regarded as a half-face hunter who is under searched with big bonus in the underground city. In order to leave the underground city to find his mother, Zachary has to agree to fight with the old wizard, the King of the underground city. Under Scarlett's training, Zachary grew up fast. In the battle, his determination to protect the Rooney inspired the strength in the necklace and defeated the old wizard. And just when the angry wizard decided to show his real strength, the real half hunter came to the rescue. The real half hunter even had the same necklace. The unexpected encounter of the two necklaces triggered the emergence of spirits and demons which are eager for energy. In order to protect the underground city from being ravage, the half-face hunter left the underground city with Zachary and his friends. They used their tactics to temporarily eliminate the demons in the stone forest near the beast forest, and they entered the beast forest to avoid refuge.</desc>

    <title>Indian Martial Art</title>
    <desc>India has a deep cultural heritage in mythological and historical battles fought for supremacy. The Hindu culture has a warrior clan called Kshatriyas whose main job was to practice the art of war and might. The Mahabharata war tale describes various forms of fighting with weapons such as maces, swords, lances, bows, arrows and even hand to hand combat like Mall yuddha or Dwand yuddha. Dhanurveda, a section found in the Vedas (1700 BCE - 1100 BCE) contains references to martial arts. Around the 3rd century BC, the yoga sutras of Patanjali presented the technique of meditating single-mindedly on points located inside one's body, which were later used in martial arts. While various mudra finger movements were also taught in Yogacara Buddhism. These elements of yoga, as well as finger movements in the nata dances were incorporated into various Indian martial arts. The art of fighting is prominently mentioned in various ancient texts. From antiquity to the middle-ages and the modern era several techniques were indigenously developed in parts of India which are known as the Indian Martial arts. ‘Indian martial arts' refers to the fighting systems of the Indian subcontinent in South Asia. This now includes India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal. Indian martial arts were an important influence in the development of a number of modern Asian martial arts, particularly within the Indian cultural sphere (countries outside India influenced by Indian culture and religion) of Southeast Asia. Contrary to the popular belief that Martial Arts were invented by the Chinese, it actually has deep roots in the Indian History and Hindu Mythology. Bodhidharma, a Buddhist Monk from South India, is credited with first teaching Kung Fu at the Shaolin Temple. Through the show, Martial Arts – The Indian Legacy, delve deeper into the roots of the sport in India and the different types of martial arts that continues to exist even today in various parts of the country and how they have affected history.</desc>

    <title>Kahi Suni</title>
    <desc>In a land steeped in mysticism, spirituality, and religion, the imagination of the followers has much room to flourish. Stories abound – some based on truth and some only on fractions of the truth. Nevertheless, these stories have enchanted their listeners for eons. Kahi Suni packs away our skepticism and takes us on a ride through the legendary tales of India. Each destination covered in the episodes has been the birthplace of a legend and each legend has given rise to the recognition of that location. Following our host from north to south and east to west, we journey through the land of myths of legends uncovering the origins of evIery story.</desc>
