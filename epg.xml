    <title>Armor Monster Ep 21</title>
    <desc>One day, 12-year-old Zachary once again met the subway "0" which her mother took nine years ago, and the appearance of the subway seems to have some connection with the necklace left by her mother. In order to find her mother, Zachary stepped on the magic subway without hesitation! When the train arrived at the station, Zachary found that he had come to a magical world of elves. He also met the elf Rooney chased by hunters. In order to protect the Rooney, they fled to the underground city. Here, Zachary meets Scarlett, a red haired girl, and Zachary accidently becomes the Rooney and is regarded as a half-face hunter who is under searched with big bonus in the underground city. In order to leave the underground city to find his mother, Zachary has to agree to fight with the old wizard, the King of the underground city. Under Scarlett's training, Zachary grew up fast. In the battle, his determination to protect the Rooney inspired the strength in the necklace and defeated the old wizard. And just when the angry wizard decided to show his real strength, the real half hunter came to the rescue. The real half hunter even had the same necklace. The unexpected encounter of the two necklaces triggered the emergence of spirits and demons which are eager for energy. In order to protect the underground city from being ravage, the half-face hunter left the underground city with Zachary and his friends. They used their tactics to temporarily eliminate the demons in the stone forest near the beast forest, and they entered the beast forest to avoid refuge.</desc>

    <title>Armor Monster Ep 22</title>
    <desc>One day, 12-year-old Zachary once again met the subway "0" which her mother took nine years ago, and the appearance of the subway seems to have some connection with the necklace left by her mother. In order to find her mother, Zachary stepped on the magic subway without hesitation! When the train arrived at the station, Zachary found that he had come to a magical world of elves. He also met the elf Rooney chased by hunters. In order to protect the Rooney, they fled to the underground city. Here, Zachary meets Scarlett, a red haired girl, and Zachary accidently becomes the Rooney and is regarded as a half-face hunter who is under searched with big bonus in the underground city. In order to leave the underground city to find his mother, Zachary has to agree to fight with the old wizard, the King of the underground city. Under Scarlett's training, Zachary grew up fast. In the battle, his determination to protect the Rooney inspired the strength in the necklace and defeated the old wizard. And just when the angry wizard decided to show his real strength, the real half hunter came to the rescue. The real half hunter even had the same necklace. The unexpected encounter of the two necklaces triggered the emergence of spirits and demons which are eager for energy. In order to protect the underground city from being ravage, the half-face hunter left the underground city with Zachary and his friends. They used their tactics to temporarily eliminate the demons in the stone forest near the beast forest, and they entered the beast forest to avoid refuge.</desc>

    <desc>The proud Princess likes to do things her own way, but her antics are always joined by her restless brother, Prince, who tends to turn everything topsy-turvy. Any playtime in their room transforms into a fantastic journey through unusual worlds: the children arrange a picnic on the Moon, conduct a detective investigation in a toy city, or search for pirate treasures on islands! Although initially, the Princess and Prince seem to clash and compete, by the end, they always find joy in each other' s company and that of their cherished dog, Bona.</desc>

    <title>Umeed India</title>
    <desc>If you'd imagine an ace cricketer to host a television show, you can be sure it will be a sports related series. And, Umeed India makes a compelling case. For the first time, versatile cricketer Virender Sehwag will host a television show. Umeed India will showcase groundbreaking stories of diversified, intrepid athletes aiming for glory at Olympics 2020. For the 13-part series, Virender reinstates the fact that Olympic stars never ‘just' appear at the Games. Their stories start in small villages, where they train every day – with one aim in mind – bringing home that Gold. Watch Virender travel to their training bases, chronicling exciting moments in the home environment besides interviewing the athletes' families and coaching staff. The episodes feature inspiring stories of OP Karhana, Suyash Yadav, Avtar Singh and Dutee Chand along with Sakshi Malik, Vinesh Poghat among many other Olympians. Can we find the 2020 medalists for India in 2017?</desc>

    <desc>What better way to feel good than delightful Cantonese comfort food? Talented home cook Mary Tang give us the lowdown on how to make crunchy, flavoursome Shrimp Toast. To spice it up, she boils a simmering hot pot of a traditional Cantonese soup - Congee. Normally eaten at breakfast, this delicious silky rice soup is loaded with succulent ground pork, earthy shiitake mushrooms, and aromatic ginger and scallions. Next, Mary swears that White Cut Chicken is the ultimate Cantonese comfort food. Slow-poached in juicy chicken stock paired with fresh broccoli and topped with fiery gingERS-scallion oil, this dish adds a little extra warmth to your life. For dessert, Mary whips up a batch of sweet, cloud-like Coconut Pudding that will surly melt-in-your-mouth. (S3 E03)</desc>

    <desc>China celebrates harvest with the Moon Festival, when the moon is at its fullest during mid-autumn. The best part? A delicious feast! Cantonese expert Mary Tang prepares a common Moon Festival dish - earthy and tasty Mushroom Stir Fry. Then, she cooks up a mouth-watering, Cantonese must-have - Steamed Crab. Using flawless technique, Mary breaks the juicy crab into pieces, fries and steams it in scented spices and sauces. Another Moon Festival staple is Cantonese Roast Duck - Mary uses sweet-savoury Chinese five-spice powder, dark soy sauce, and aromatic white pepper to make a fragrant rub. Finally, Moon Cake at the Moon Festival a given.
