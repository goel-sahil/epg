    <desc>One day, 12-year-old Zachary once again met the subway "0" which her mother took nine years ago, and the appearance of the subway seems to have some connection with the necklace left by her mother. In order to find her mother, Zachary stepped on the magic subway without hesitation! When the train arrived at the station, Zachary found that he had come to a magical world of elves. He also met the elf Rooney chased by hunters. In order to protect the Rooney, they fled to the underground city. Here, Zachary meets Scarlett, a red haired girl, and Zachary accidently becomes the Rooney and is regarded as a half-face hunter who is under searched with big bonus in the underground city. In order to leave the underground city to find his mother, Zachary has to agree to fight with the old wizard, the King of the underground city. Under Scarlett's training, Zachary grew up fast. In the battle, his determination to protect the Rooney inspired the strength in the necklace and defeated the old wizard. And just when the angry wizard decided to show his real strength, the real half hunter came to the rescue. The real half hunter even had the same necklace. The unexpected encounter of the two necklaces triggered the emergence of spirits and demons which are eager for energy. In order to protect the underground city from being ravage, the half-face hunter left the underground city with Zachary and his friends. They used their tactics to temporarily eliminate the demons in the stone forest near the beast forest, and they entered the beast forest to avoid refuge.</desc>

    <title>Kahi Suni</title>
    <desc>In a land steeped in mysticism, spirituality, and religion, the imagination of the followers has much room to flourish. Stories abound – some based on truth and some only on fractions of the truth. Nevertheless, these stories have enchanted their listeners for eons. Kahi Suni packs away our skepticism and takes us on a ride through the legendary tales of India.
